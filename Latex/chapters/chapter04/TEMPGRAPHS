\mycaption[Pose representation using distance and velocity]{Distance data is shown in blue and velocity data shown in green.
(a) All skeleton data has been plotted, with the x-axis corresponding to a joint co-ordinate. There are 20 joints each represented by 3 co-ordinates (x,y,z) hence the range 0-60. We can see a spike at ~40 which corresponds to joints 15 and onwards which are the right hip, right knee, right ankle and right foot. The y-axis represents distance from the Kinect in the z direction which explains the spike since in a boxing stance the right hand side of the body should be further away.
(b) Hip Joint over Time}
