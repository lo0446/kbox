\paragraph{Further Work}
Introduce movement
Deal with normalisation via joint angles.


talk about effect of EigenVectors



\paragraph{Conclusion}
Conclude in some way

\paragraph{Normalisation}
HIP.



Notes:
Missing why some classifiers perform better than others?
Why does random forest do a worst job than a descicion tree?



\paragraph{LIMITATIONS}
*Cannot deal with movement while punch is being thrown
*Need to be a set distance from the Kinect
