\paragraph{Data Format}
I record data from the Kinect in a space separated text file with each line corresponding to one timeframe. The structure of a line is: 
tracking_flag x_0 y_0 z_0 tracking_flag x_1 y_1 z_1 ... tracking_flag x_19 y_19 z_19,
where x_i,y_i,z_i are the x,y,z coordinates representing the position of the ith joint.
Each new line is represented by a very large value that could not represent a Kinect measurement. (e.g. 2000000) 
The tracking_flag is an integer which describes the status of the joint:
Joint not tracked = 0, Joint position inferred = 1, Join position tracked = 2.
If the joint is not tracked the position is set to (-10000, -10000, -10000) and it should not be used.
The position of the camera is (0,0,0).

DTW
After using dynamic time warping I found that there was not enough difference between the various punch signals to give me an effective way at segmentation. Comparing jabs to other jabs yielded similarity values from $0 - 1.589$ with an average difference of $0.499$, comparing jabs to crosses yielded similarity values from $0-2.113$ with the average $0.716$. Therefore there was not enough of a consistent difference score to be able to classify they type of punch using this method.

FFT
 I investigated the possibility of running a fast Fourier transform (FFT) on the raw data as well as each segmented punch that was later obtained from using PCA and my own segmentation algorithm. The range for the coefficients was $0 - (63.030 - 0i)$ with a spread across all of the different types of punches. 
Unfortunately this meant the coefficients obtained in both cases proved to be a poor differentiator between punches due to the coefficients being so variable even within the same punch types.

PCA

Once the data has been successfully segmented into individual punches we can begin to extract features that can be used to train a classifier. Between 12 and 15 evenly spaced samples are taken for each individual punch, depending on the classifier to be used later. Each sample corresponds to a point in time which is used to extract the 3 principal coefficients for each point which results in a $36 - 45$ features for each punch.

Once all the different punch sequences are sampled for each type of punch we can use this data to train a classifier. A multi-class SVM, decision tree, Random Forest and neural network were tested. .............
